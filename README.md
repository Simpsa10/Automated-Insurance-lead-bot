# Automated-Insurance-lead-bot
A friend contacted me with a request to help him get an edge in his career field.
The user works in health insurance and is required to purchase leads through memos sent to them. 
Recently he has been noticing that his competition has been buying out all the leads whithin a few seconds.
He requested I make a program that automates buying the leads. The program uses an artificial cell phone number to recieve the memo from the company
and re-routes it to a local server using flask and then automates the purchases of all leads. The process from recieving the lead to purchasing the leads
takes on average under 5 seconds.
